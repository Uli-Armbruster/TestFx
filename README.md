We love clean code, but still our tests are often difficult to read or take more time than actually implementing the stuff. TestFx is a framework that brings testing to the next level:

- **Readability:** Like code, tests are written once, but read often. That's why reading a tests should be like reading a story or a specification. TestFx improves readability by introducing a fluent interface that is short, clean, expressive, and extensible.
- **Flexibility:** As a good developer we know all these wonderful features like generics, lambda expressions or extension methods. TestFx encourages you to use them all in order to make your tests context-aware in every single line.
- **Integration:** The .NET community serves us with such great tools so that we only have one choice - integrate them. TestFx currently comes with dedicated support for ReSharper and FakeItEasy.
- **Extensibility:** Besides the fluent syntax, it is also possible to extend the framework with your own test language. You just have to implement some basic interfaces and will have most of the ReSharper support out of the box.
